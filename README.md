# TheGamingRoom
The Gaming room is a client who wanted to extend their clientele for a pre-existing game, Draw It or Lose It.
They wanted a game where the application would render images over a period of time, and a team would then guess the image.
While developing the documentation I felt like a thing I did well was example security requirements.
A part of the documentation that was helpful was a UML diagram.  It allowed myself to more clearly see classes and attributes to add
to the code.  Implementation was much easier due to the UML.  I still have much more to learn about software design and developement
and believe I could improve in all areas, but I do believe my overall organization would be the best thing to improve.  
The user wanted a multi-platform game which would run well cross platform.  Taking this into account gave a budget and framework
to the client and my team.  Considering user needs is what makes the product itself.  If you aren't meeting their needs are you
even trying to work for your client?  I did a generic UML to software design/creation approach.  By first planning and then implementing code.
I need to more familiarize myself with an IDE for efficient coding in the future.
